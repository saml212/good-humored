# Fix: split the command on shell separators (; & |), then scan segments in

# also handles "torchrun --nproc-per-node 8 src/train.py --arg X" layouts,

# Narrow the matcher to actual training/eval entry points (issue #24 bug
# 3). The prior matcher fired on ANY `python3 <file>.py`, including the
# harness's own lint/utility scripts (e.g. skills/clean/audit.py) —
# demanding a "forward+backward+grad check" dry run for a linter, which
# trains users to reflexively register sentinels and defeats the gate.
#
# Heuristic (fail-closed on ambiguity — a false BLOCK is a papercut, a
# false PASS burns real GPU money):
#   - accelerate/torchrun/deepspeed are ALWAYS enforced. No legitimate
#     utility script needs a distributed/multi-GPU launcher, so there is
#     no ambiguity to resolve in that case.
#   - A bare `python`/`pythonX.Y` invocation is exempted ONLY if the
#     target script is readable AND contains none of the standard
#     training-framework signals (torch/jax/tensorflow/transformers/
#     pytorch_lightning/deepspeed/accelerate imports, or a
#     backward()/optimizer.step()/Trainer/TrainingArguments call).
#     Unreadable, unresolved, or any doubt falls through to the existing
#     sentinel check (blocked unless already registered) — the default
#     stays fail-closed.
#
# Known blind spot: a bare-python script with no training-framework
# import that itself shells out to (or dynamically execs/imports) real
# training code — e.g. `os.system("torchrun real_train.py")` — is
# exempted here, because ITS OWN source has no training signal; the
# nested invocation never reaches this hook as a separate Bash command.
# Banning subprocess/os.system in exempted scripts would close that gap
# but reintroduces false blocks on ordinary CLI tools that shell out for
# unrelated reasons; flagging for follow-up rather than guessing.
